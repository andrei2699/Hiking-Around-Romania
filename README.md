# HikingAroundRomania

## General Description 

The Website provides nature lovers with the necessary means to organize and register for various trips. Thus, the site works with 2 types of users: Trip Organizer and Regular User

## Authentication

For Registring, the user must enter their name, email address, password and the user type. Some part of website can be visualised without registration.
Login can be made using email and password or social login via Google Account

## Profile

Both types of users have a profile page. Contact details and a gallery with suggestive pictures can be viewed on the profile page of the event organizer. The regular user profile contains two sections, one for future trips and the other for details on trips he has already taken.

## Events

Event organizers can create or edit events using a form. This form must contain information such as: the name of the event, the name of the organizer, the location of the event, the description, the period of the event, the transport, the accommodation and the price of organizing the event, but also the other costs. Once created, the events can be viewed on the main page.

A fee will be charged for creating events. Also, different discounts and bonuses can be applied for both roles.

## Seat Reservation

Regular users can reserve seats at certain events, and they move to the shopping cart. The purchase is made with the card for one or more events at once. This is necessary to ensure that the organizer attends the event.

## Other

The main page will contain a section with upcoming events and another section to present the most beautiful regions in our country. 
The About Us page contains a list of information about all registered event organizers. Both future trips and organizers can be searched using various filters.
